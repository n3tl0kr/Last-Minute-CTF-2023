# Last Minute CTF 2023
## Blue Team Con 2023
The Last Minute Capture the Flag [CTF] event is back for another year during Blue Team Con. This is a beginner-friendly CTF competition. Originally, this was a very last minute thing. This time, not quite so late, and with much better planning, but "Not Last Minute CTF" isn't as fun. However, we continue to provide a fun game via a unique learning experience. As this is being run at Blue Team Con, all of the puzzles and challenges will be related as best we can to defensive cybersecurity topics. Remember, we want you to learn, we just might not make everything too easy...

However, a big difference that we can impart on this competition compared to other competitions, is that the Last Minute CTF wants to see you document your work and provide write-ups for each of the challenges. Half of the available points will come directly from these write-ups. While documentation is not something for everyone, it is a highly desirable skill to have and use in any day-to-day operation and who knows, we may even feature your write-up and tell everyone how awesome you did the thing!

Whether you have never played a CTF before, or have been completing challenges for years, we want you to play.
